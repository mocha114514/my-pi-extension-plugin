# MPEP

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A lightweight extension suite that polishes Pi's shell interface.

Built entirely on Pi's own extension mechanism — zero source modification, easy to attach and remove.

### Interface Optimization

Compact tool output, expandable details, Markdown rendering enhancements, and more.

While a response is executing:

![Executing view](assets/executing-view.png)

The finished round collapses automatically:

Double-click to expand:

### Turn Navigator

Adds a navigator on the right side to quickly review each round's user prompt and jump to it with a click.

### Statusline

An improved version of Pi's native statusline.

Shows model, project, Git and token usage information, among other data.

### Usage

Token usage, costs, daily totals and model price editing.

### Theme Distributor

Ships the bundled `mpep-blue` theme. On first load it installs the theme into `~/.pi/agent/themes/` and selects it automatically. The installation is one-shot: if the theme file already exists, your manual theme choice is never overridden.

Disabling the plugin through `/m-mng` uninstalls it: the theme file is removed and the previously selected theme is restored (falls back to Pi's default `dark`).

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl+C no longer clears the input box text.
- With mouse-selected text, Ctrl+C copies it instead of quitting Pi; pressing Ctrl+C with nothing selected asks for confirmation first to prevent accidental exits.
- With mouse-selected text, direct deletion (Backspace / Delete) and overwrite (Ctrl+V) are supported.
- With mouse-selected text, line cutting (Ctrl+X) is supported.
- Ctrl+- / Ctrl+_ for undo; Windows additionally supports Ctrl+Z.

Note: the TPS plugin comes from the official [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) repository implementation.

### Install and Update

```bash
pi install git:github.com/mocha114514/my-pi-extension-plugin
pi update git:github.com/mocha114514/my-pi-extension-plugin
```

Then manually delete `~/.pi/agent/mpep-cache/` if you want a full cleanup.

### Commands

| Command              | Purpose                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/m-mng`             | Enable or disable extensions you like/dislike  |
| `/m-mng list`        | List plugin states                             |

### Data Location

- Configuration, plugin switches and usage data are stored in **`~/.pi/agent/mpep-cache/`**, separate from the installation directory. Follows `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` when set; project-level installations also use the same user data directory.
